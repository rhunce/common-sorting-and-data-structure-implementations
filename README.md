# Common Sorting And Data Structure Implementations

## About
This project implements common sorting algorithms, data structures, and search algorithms in Javascript. The implementations include test cases and the time and space complexity of the various algorithms and data structure methods. Feel free to look through the files or to fork.

### Core Sorting Algorithms
- [x] Bubble sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Merge sort
- [x] Quick sort
- [x] Selection sort

### Other Advanced Sorting Algorithms
- [ ] Bucket sort
- [ ] Counting Sort
- [ ] Heap sort
- [ ] Radix Sort
- [ ] Shell sort

### Core Data Structures
- [x] Array List
- [ ] Binary Search Tree
- [ ] Binary Tree
- [x] Graph
- [x] Hash Table
- [x] Linked List
- [x] Max Heap
- [x] Min Heap
- [x] Queue
- [x] Stack
- [ ] Tree

### Other Advanced Data Structures
- TBD
