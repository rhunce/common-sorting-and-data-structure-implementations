# Common Sorting And Data Structure Implementations

## About
This project implements common sorting algorithms, data structures, and search algorithms in Javascript. The implementations include test cases and the time and space complexity of the various algorithms and data structure methods. Feel free to look through the files or to fork.

### Core Sorting Algorithms
- [x] Bubble sort
- [x] Selection sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Quick sort
- [x] Merge sort

### Other Advanced Sorting Algorithms
- [ ] Bucket sort
- [ ] Shell sort
- [ ] Heap sort
- [ ] Counting Sort
- [ ] Radix Sort

### Core Data Structures
- [ ] Linked List
- [ ] Hash Table
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Tree
- [ ] Binary Tree
- [ ] Binary Search Tree
- [ ] Min Heap
- [ ] Max Heap
- [ ] Graph

### Other Advanced Data Structures
- TBD
